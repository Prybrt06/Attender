# Attender Project

Attender is a project that consists of a backend and a frontend. The backend is responsible for running the server, while the frontend is built using Flutter and allows you to run the app.

## Prerequisites

Before running the project, you'll need to have the following installed on your machine:

- Node.js and npm
- Flutter SDK
- Git

## Getting Started

Follow the steps below to get the project up and running:

### Clone the Repository

```bash
git clone https://github.com/your-username/attender.git
cd attender
```

### Backend Setup

1. Navigate to the backend directory:

```bash
cd backend
```

2. Install the dependencies:

```bash
npm install
```

3. Run the backend server:

The backend server should now be up and running on a specified port (usually 4000).

### Frontend Setup

1. Navigate to the frontend directory:

```bash
cd ../frontend
```

2. Install the Flutter dependencies:

```bash
flutter pub get
```

3. Connect a mobile device (iOS/Android) to your development machine or use an emulator/simulator.

4. Run the app:


```bash
flutter run
```
